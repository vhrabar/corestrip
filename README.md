# Plasma widgets

Panel widgets for Plasma 6, built on KDE's own data sources — no polling
scripts, no background daemons of their own.

| Widget | What it does |
|---|---|
| [Corestrip](widgets/corestrip/) | CPU, GPU, memory, network and disk load, with a detail popup |
| [Daystrip](widgets/daystrip/) | Clock, date and weather, with a calendar, forecast and agenda popup |
| [Tunestrip](widgets/tunestrip/) | What is playing: album art, an animated equalizer and controls |

## Install

```sh
./install.sh                # every widget
./install.sh daystrip       # just one
```

Then add it: right-click the panel → *Add or Manage Widgets…*

To remove: `./uninstall.sh daystrip`.

## Build a bundle

```sh
./package.sh                # dist/<widget>-<version>.plasmoid
./package.sh daystrip
```

A `.plasmoid` bundle is what store.kde.org and Plasma's *Get New Widgets*
accept. Pushing a `v*` tag builds every bundle in CI and attaches them to the
GitHub release.

Every push and pull request runs `tools/check-versions.sh`, which insists that
each widget's `metadata.json` version and the newest heading in its changelog
say the same thing — that version is what *Get New Widgets* compares, so a
bundle must never go out labelled with a version nobody wrote notes for.

Each widget keeps its own README, changelog, screenshots and packaging under
`widgets/<name>/`.
