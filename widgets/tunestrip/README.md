# Tunestrip

A Plasma 6 panel widget for whatever is playing — album art, an animated
equalizer and the title in the panel, full controls one click away.

## What it shows

**In the panel** — album art, the equalizer, the title block and the transport
buttons, each optional and in whatever order you put them. A hairline under the
widget tracks the position. Long titles scroll; the text size scales the whole
strip at once.

**In the popup** — the cover at a readable size, title, artist and album, a
seek bar, shuffle, previous, play, next and repeat, the volume, and a list of
players when more than one is running.

**Hovering** shows the cover, the track and how far into it you are.

The scroll wheel over the widget changes the volume and a middle click plays or
pauses — both can be switched off.

## About the volume

MPRIS carries a volume, but for most of what people play it is decoration:
browsers and Spotify report 100 % for ever and ignore what is written to it.
So the wheel moves the level that is actually heard — the one PulseAudio keeps
for the player's own audio stream, the same slider the mixer shows.

The stream is matched to the player on screen by process id, then by name, and
finally by "one player is playing and one application is making sound". When
nothing matches — a phone over KDE Connect, Spotify Connect on another box —
the MPRIS volume is used instead, and the settings can force that.

## Where the data comes from

MPRIS2 on the session bus, the same interface Plasma's own media controls read.
Anything that announces itself there is understood:

- browsers, through `plasma-browser-integration` (YouTube, Spotify web, and the
  rest),
- desktop players — VLC, Elisa, Amarok, Audacious, Clementine, Strawberry,
- `mpv` with an MPRIS plugin, `mpd` through `mpDris2`, Spotify's own client.

Nothing is polled except the position, and only while something plays and only
while a view actually shows it.

## About the equalizer

It is an indicator, not a spectrum analyser. A Plasma applet cannot read the
audio stream — that would take a capture client and a native plugin — so the
motion is generated from the track rather than measured from it. It is
deterministic, so it never jumps on a repaint, and it settles to a flat line
when the music stops.

Five styles: bars, blocks, wave, dots and pulse. The colour can follow the
album art, the accent colour or the text colour.

## Settings

- **Panel** — what to show and in which order, text size, title width, the
  second line with the artist, scrolling titles, the progress line, collapsing
  when nothing plays, wheel and middle-click behaviour, which volume the wheel
  moves and by how much per notch.
- **Equalizer** — style, columns, speed, colour, whether it keeps moving while
  paused. The page shows a live preview.
- **Popup** — album art, equalizer, seek bar, volume, player list.

## Install

From this checkout:

```sh
./install.sh tunestrip     # from the repository root
```

Then right-click the panel → *Add or Manage Widgets…* → **Tunestrip**.

As a system package (Arch/Manjaro): `makepkg -si` in this directory.

## Requirements

Plasma 6 and `plasma-workspace` — the MPRIS reader ships with it. For browser
playback, install `plasma-browser-integration` and its extension.
